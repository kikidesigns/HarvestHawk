A robot providing real-time data about your crops' health and yield potential.

## Project Description

Picture this: an autonomous robot tirelessly watching over your fieldâ€™s day and night, providing real-time data about your crops' health and yield potential; a robot that is able to monitor how much sun your plants are getting, how much humidity is in the air, and measure the air pressure to warn of an incoming storm. It sounds futuristic, right? Well, the future of precision agriculture is here.

## Overall Project Completion Goals

For overall completion I want the product to be able to achieve the following:
- Read the air pressure using a barometer.
- Measure solar radiation using a pyranometer.
- Humidity sensor to track humidity.
- Weather-resistant.

## Milestone Goals

- **Milestone 1:** Design a weather-resistant shell for the electronics as well as the shaft to hold/cover the electronics and stick into the ground. Find the exact parts to be used and create a schematic.
- **Milestone 2:** Wire hardware together based off schematics and connect to the 3D designed body. Code the components to do the tasks as needed.
- **Milestone 3:** Field test, debug, calibrate as needed.
